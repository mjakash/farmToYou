Use microservices architecture to build an android app which will be very loosely coupled, the app will feature a service, that will interact between customer and farmer. The idea is basically the user will be able to order raw vegetables directly from the farmer, the user will be able to order only in bulk, the order will be placed only if it hits minimum criteria of 5kgs or Rs 1000 per order. The system will be able to track the order status, delivery guy location when the order is out for delivery, the app should show us timelines of what will be the status of sell is. Ask for more details about the product, also make a mock payment gateway for now, all the services will be under microservices architecture which will be modular and loosely coupled. Ask for questions which you think is necessary, also the app will feature in both website and mobile app, I don't have the best idea when it comes to mobile development so choose the best application to build the app.
